# signal-scanner-tradingview
This script scans for signals on tradingview.com [DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE]

I created this as a practice project when I was learning Python

What it does:
- Opens tradingview.com
- Opens the specified chart
- Sets specified parameters
- Waits for conditions to be fulfilled
- Sends an email to the user when the conditions are met

This was only created to implement a basic trading strategy and is not very effective for generating profits.
I created this project in March 2022 and the website has been updated since that time, so this script does not work anymore
